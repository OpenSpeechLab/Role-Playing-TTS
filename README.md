## üìö Usage Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository and Download Models

First, you need to clone this project and download the required model files.

**a. Clone this project:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Riddae/Role-Playing-TTS.git
cd Role-Playing-TTS
```

**b. Download dependencies:**
This project depends on MMAudio and CosyVoice. Please download them as follows.
```bash
# Download MMAudio library
git clone https://github.com/hkchengrex/MMAudio.git
cd TTS # Enter the TTS directory
# Download CosyVoice library
git clone https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice.git
cd CosyVoice # Enter the CosyVoice directory
```
**c. Download model files:**

```bash
python download.py
```

### 2. Configure the Environment

To ensure the system runs stably, please configure your Python environment according to the following steps.
```bash
# Create a new environment named 'audio' with Python 3.10
conda create -n audio -y python=3.10
# Activate the newly created environment
conda activate audio

pip install -r requirements.txt

cd /TTS/CosyVoice/pretrained_models/CosyVoice-ttsfrd
unzip resource.zip -d .
pip install ttsfrd_dependency-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
pip install ttsfrd-0.4.2-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### 3. Run the System
Now you can run Role-Playing-TTS in the following ways. We provide two main modes: an API service and a command-line pipeline.

**a. Start the API Service:**
First, start the backend API service so that subsequent programs can interact with it.
```bash
# Execute in the root directory of Role-Playing-TTS
python services.py
```
Set environment variables for using API services GPT-4 API

Please modify the OPENAI_PROXY and OPENAI_KEY parameter in  `pipeline.py `<br>
OPENAI_PROXY = "your_openai_proxy"<br>
OPENAI_KEY = "your_openai_key"<br>
**b. Use the Command-Line Pipeline for TTS Synthesis**
You can generate speech directly from the command line. Here is an example of generating an audio drama about "Journey to the West".


```bash
# Make sure you have activated the 'audio' environment
# Make sure services.py is running
python pipeline.py --text "ËØ∑‰Ω†ÂàõÈÄ†‰∏Ä‰∏™ÂîêÂÉßÂ∏àÂæíÂõõ‰∫∫Ë•øÂ§©ÂèñÁªèÁöÑÊúâÂ£∞Áü≠Ââß" --output_path output
```
--text: The content you want to synthesize (characters + theme).<br>
--output_path: The generated audio file will be saved to this path.<br>
--step1: The dialogue content to be generated (optional). Provide the character dialogue, and GPT will analyze it to add sound effects and BGM.<br>
--step2: The complete version with sound effects, BGM, and dialogue (optional). Provide the sound effects, BGM, and dialogue, and the model will generate the audio directly.<br>
For the format of step1 and step2, please refer to the files in the `output` directory.

**c. Launch the Web UI (Recommended):**
To provide a more user-friendly experience, we offer a web interface.
```bash
# Make sure you have activated the 'audio' environment
# Make sure services.py is running
python web.py
```
We only provide voices for a dozen or so characters, such as Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Tang Seng, Nezha, Taiyi Zhenren, etc. For details, please see `char_to_voice_map.json`. You can add more voices by following the format in `char_to_voice_map.json` if needed.
